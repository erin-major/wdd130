                <p>Hello! My name is Erin Major and I'm from Utah, USA. I enjoy reading, playing board games, and being in nature. I want to travel to as many countries as possible. I love seeing the culture and food differences around the world. I also love to look at architecture, especially old buildings. I'm currently working for a SaaS tech company as a QA Analyst. I love my job, but want to expand my skills and learn to be an SDET. I find deep satisfaction in writing a test, watching it run, and knowing that feature is covered moving forward.</p>
